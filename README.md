# Simple MQTT Temperature Sensor Node

This is pretty minimal code for running a temperature sensor on ESP8266 that has a DHT11 sensor connected to pin 2. 
The main pourpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use pubsubclient library for sending data to an MQTT-broker.

Using Eclipse with Arduino plugin this project should be usable as is. In Arduino IDE you need pubsublibrary:
